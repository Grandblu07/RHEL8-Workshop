= Pbench Agent Fundamentals

== Overview

In this unit, we will get familiar with the Pbench Agent, the CLI it provides, and the available containers offered.  

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node1` as user `root`, and hosts `node2` and `node3` as user `cloud-user`.

From host `workstation`, ssh to `node1`.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *ssh node1*
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your priviledges.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *sudo -i*
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *cheat-pbench-checkhost.sh*
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.
